1. Game Engine
   Purpose: To handle the overall game loop, rendering, and updating of game objects.
   Implementation: Create a custom game engine using TypeScript, or utilize an existing TypeScript-compatible engine like Phaser.

2. Physics System
   Purpose: To manage the movement, collision detection, and interactions between game objects.
   Implementation: Integrate a physics library like Matter.js or Box2D with the game engine to handle the physics system.

3. Input Handling
   Purpose: To process player input from keyboard, mouse, or game controllers.
   Implementation: Develop an input handling module that listens for input events and maps them to game actions.

4. Level Management
   Purpose: To load, manage, and transition between game levels.
   Implementation: Create a level management module that reads level data from JSON or Tiled map files and constructs the corresponding game objects and environments.

5. Character and Enemy AI
   Purpose: To control the behavior of the player character, enemies, and NPCs.
   Implementation: Develop a character and enemy AI module that implements various behaviors, such as patrolling, chasing, and attacking, based on the game object's state and the player's actions.

6. Power-ups and Upgrades System
   Purpose: To manage the collection, activation, and effects of power-ups and upgrades.
   Implementation: Create a power-ups and upgrades system that handles the spawning, collection, and application of power-ups and upgrades to the player character.

7. Save and Load System
   Purpose: To save and load the player's progress, including level completion, power-ups, and upgrades.
   Implementation: Develop a save and load system that stores the player's progress in local storage or a server-side database.

8. User Interface (UI) and Heads-Up Display (HUD)
   Purpose: To display game information, such as health, ammunition, and menus, to the player.
   Implementation: Create a UI and HUD module that dynamically updates and renders game information using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.

9. Audio Management
   Purpose: To manage the playback of music, sound effects, and ambient sounds.
   Implementation: Develop an audio management module that handles the loading, playback, and volume control of audio assets.

10. Animation System
    Purpose: To animate game objects, such as characters, enemies, and environmental elements.
    Implementation: Create an animation system that handles sprite sheet animations, frame-by-frame animations, and tweening for smooth transitions.

11. Decision and Story Progression System
    Purpose: To track the player's decisions and story progression, affecting the game's outcome and faction allegiances.
    Implementation: Develop a decision and story progression system that stores the player's choices and updates the game world accordingly.
