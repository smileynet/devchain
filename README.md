# DevChain

## Overview

This repo is my collection of examples and applications as I try to understand
how to make the most of [LangChain]().

Much of the code is lifted directly from their documentation site, but I have
made some changes to make it easier for me to understand and broken out functions
for ease of use in future projects.

This may end up as a package for use in future projects if the meteoric pace of
AI development doesn't render it irrelevant in a week. Similarly this has been
done in Node.js to avoid wasting extra time putting it all in a web interface for now.

## Getting Started

1. yarn install
2. yarn cli

The current available modes are:

1. Games, currently there is a game design chain meant to help with initial ideation for a game
1. Applications, including a simple application design chain
1. Tests, which allow for A/B testing of things like prompts with and without vector stores
1. Examples, which run canned examples copied or derived from the LangChain documentation
